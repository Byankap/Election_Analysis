## Election-Audit Summary
##### Business Proposal
In the future, there will be more elections, and program like, PyPoll_Challenge.py, it will be very helpful to have to calculate votes and the winner. 
#####
In order to use this program, first continue to save CSV files in the resource folder and the TXT file inside the analysis folder, so the path remains correct. Just ensure if the CSV or TXT file are renamed differently, to update it on the path. 
#####
Lastly, future CSV must remain as the same format as "election_analysis.csv," three columns with the following headers: Ballot ID, County, and Candidate.
